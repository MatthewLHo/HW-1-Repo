This is my new weapon, a huge slingshot... named Kabuto!
Have a good look at its power!
Special attack... Firebird Star!

Oh, no...!

Mission accomplished.

Th-They've gone and done it!

Do they understand what it means to attack the flag?!
The pirates declared war against the World Government!

Are you insane?! Don't think that you'll be able to survive
after making the entire world your enemy!

Bring it on!
Robin!
We still haven't heard you say it!
Say you want to live!
Robin...
Robin!

To live...

You shouldn't be allowed to live in this world, Robin!
Your existence itself is a huge crime, Robin!

I thought it was something I dared not wish for.
No one ever let me wish for it.
I want to die!

Right. The sea is vast, so someday, definitely...
...you'll come across friends who'll protect you!
Believe in Luffy.

If... it's really okay for me to utter my wish for once...
I...
I want to live!
Take me to the sea with you!
You guys...! I love you guys, dammit!

Let's go!
